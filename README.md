Welcome to Homework 1 of the Computer Vision and Deep Learning course. This assignment covers various topics related to computer vision, and you will find instructions on how to run the code for each section below.

## Assignment Topics

1. **Camera Calibration**
   - This section focuses on camera calibration techniques. You will find code and instructions in the corresponding directory.

2. **Augmented Reality**
   - Explore augmented reality concepts in this part of the assignment. Detailed code and guidance are available in the respective folder.

3. **Stereo Disparity Map**
   - Understand how to create a disparity map in stereo vision. Code and explanations are provided in the dedicated directory.

4. **SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform)**
   - Learn about SIFT, a powerful computer vision algorithm. Code and details are available in the SIFT directory.

5. **Training a CIFAR10 Classifier Using VGG19 with BN**
   - In this section, you will train a CIFAR10 image classifier using a VGG19 model with Batch Normalization. Look for the code and guidelines in the respective folder.

## How to Run the Code

To run the code for any of the sections, please follow the steps below:

**Step 1: Install the Environment**
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory where the homework code is located.
   - Execute the following command to install the required dependencies using the provided `requirements.txt` file:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

**Step 2: Run the Application**
   - Once the environment is set up, you can run the application associated with each section. Replace `app.py` with the specific file name for the section you want to run. For example, if you want to run the Camera Calibration section, use:
     ```bash
     streamlit run app.py
     ```
   - Follow the specific instructions within each section to interact with the code and complete the assignments.
